## Learning Objectives
*  Explain what remote repositories are and why they are useful.
*  Push to or pull from a remote repository.
*  Clone a remote repository.
*  Collaborate pushing to a common repository.

## Introduction to Github

Version control really comes into its own
when we begin to collaborate with other people.
We already have most of the machinery we need to do this;
the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.
In practice,
though,
it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub,
and to keep it on the web rather than on someone's laptop.
Most programmers use hosting services like
[GitHub](http://github.com),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/)
to hold those master copies;
we'll explore the pros and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the world.
Log in to GitHub,
then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository called `planets`:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](../img/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository":

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](../img/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created,
GitHub displays a page with a URL and some information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](../img/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
~~~

Our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`,
but the remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any files yet:

![Freshly-Made GitHub Repository](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hbc/NGS_Data_Analysis_Course/master/sessionVI/img/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg)

The next step is to connect the two repositories.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a [remote](../reference.html#remote)
for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes
the string we need to identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](../img/github-find-repo-string.png)

Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the [protocol](../reference.html#protocol) from SSH to HTTPS.

> ### HTTPS vs SSH
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
> After the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more
> secure, by following one of the great tutorials from
> [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
> [Atlassian/BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git)
> and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/)
> (this one has a screencast).

![Changing the Repository URL on GitHub](../img/github-change-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser,
go into the local `planets` repository,
and run this command:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
~~~

Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's:
the only difference should be your username instead of `vlad`.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git remote -v
~~~
~~~ {.output}
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
~~~

The name `origin` is a local nickname for your remote repository:
we could use something else if we wanted to,
but `origin` is by far the most common choice.

Once the nickname `origin` is set up,
this command will push the changes from our local repository
to the repository on GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git push origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
~~~

> ### Proxy
>
> If the network you are connected to uses a proxy there is an chance that your last
> command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To
> solve this issue you need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ~~~ {.bash}
> $ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> $ git config --global https.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> ~~~
>
> When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy you will need to
> tell Git to disable the proxy using:
>
> ~~~ {.bash}
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ~~~

> ### Password Managers
>
> If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will
> try to use it when it needs your username and password. If you want to type
> your username and password at the terminal instead of using
> a password manager, type:
>
> ~~~ {.bash}
> $ unset SSH_ASKPASS
> ~~~
>
> You may want to add this command at the end of your `~/.bashrc` to make it the
> default behavior.

Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

![GitHub Repository After First Push](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hbc/NGS_Data_Analysis_Course/master/sessionVI/img/github-repo-after-first-push.svg)

> ### The '-u' Flag
>
> You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.
> It is related to concepts we cover in our intermediate lesson,
> and can safely be ignored for now.

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git pull origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
~~~

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.
If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on GitHub,
though,
this command would download them to our local repository.

***
**Exercises**

1. Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub.
 Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number). 
 Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
 What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
 How would you get that same information in the shell?

2. Create a remote repository on GitHub.
 Push the contents of your local repository to the remote.
 Make changes to your local repository and push these changes.
 Go to the repo you just created on Github and check the [timestamps](../reference.html#timestamp) of the files.
 How does GitHub record times, and why?
 
3. In this lesson, we introduced the "git push" command.
 How is "git push" different from "git commit"?

4. It happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the
 remote URL. This exercise is about how to fix this kind of issues.
 First start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:

~~~ {.bash}
 git remote add broken https://github.com/this/url/is/invalid
 ~~~

 Do you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a
 command that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not
 valid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use `git remote
 -h`)? Don't forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are done with this exercise.

***

## Collaborating with Git and Github

For the next step, get into pairs.
One person will be the "Owner" (this is the person whose Github repository will be used to start the exercise) and the other person will be the "Collaborator" (this is the person who will be cloning the Owner's repository and making changes to it).

> ### Practicing by yourself
>
> If you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening
> a second terminal window, and switching to another directory (e.g. `/tmp`).
> This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You
> won't need to give anyone access on GitHub, because both 'partners' are you.

The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.
On GitHub, click the settings button on the right,
then select Collaborators, and enter your partner's username.

![Adding collaborators on GitHub](../img/github-add-collaborators.png)

The Collaborator needs to work on this project locally. He or she should `cd` to another directory
(so `ls` doesn't show a `planets` folder),
and then make a copy of the Owner's repository:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
~~~

Replace 'vlad' with the Owner's username.

`git clone` creates a fresh local copy of a remote repository.

![After Creating Clone of Repository](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hbc/NGS_Data_Analysis_Course/master/sessionVI/img/github-collaboration.svg)

The Collaborator can now make a change in his or her copy of the repository:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cd planets
$ vim pluto.txt
$ cat pluto.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
It is so a planet!
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ git add pluto.txt
$ git commit -m "Some notes about Pluto"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
~~~

Then push the change to GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git push origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master
~~~

Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`:
Git does this automatically,
using that name,
when we clone a repository.
(This is why `origin` was a sensible choice earlier
when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

We can now download changes into the original repository on our machine:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git pull origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 9272da5..29aba7c
Fast-forward
 pluto.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
~~~

***
**Exercises**

1. The Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information to the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with command line? And on GitHub? 
 
2. The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and has some suggestions to propose. 
 
 With GitHub, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window. 

 The Collaborator posts his/her comments and suggestions using GitHub interface.

## Resolving conflicts

As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone
else's toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts](../reference.html#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve](../reference.html#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The file
`mars.txt` currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our `planets`
repository:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~

Let's add a line to one partner's copy only:

~~~ {.bash}
$ vim mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to Wolfman's copy
~~~

and then push the change to GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Adding a line in our home copy"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ git push origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
   29aba7c..dabb4c8  master -> master
~~~

Now let's have the other partner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ vim mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the other copy
~~~

We can commit the change locally:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Adding a line in my copy"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in my copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git push origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
~~~

![The conflicting changes](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hbc/NGS_Data_Analysis_Course/master/sessionVI/img/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge](../reference.html#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git pull origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.        
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.        
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)        
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
~~~

`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
=======
This line added to Wolfman's copy
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
~~~

Our change&mdash;the one in `HEAD`&mdash;is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
~~~

To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#   (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub
~~~

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git push origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 697 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  master -> master
~~~

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git pull origin master
~~~
~~~ {.output}
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.        
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.        
remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2)        
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating dabb4c8..2abf2b1
Fast-forward
 mars.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~

We get the merged file:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt 
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
~~~

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files
instead of storing everything in one large file.
There's another benefit too:
whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file,
the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users
that they ought to clarify who's responsible for what,
or find a way to divide the work up differently.

***
**Exercises**

1. Clone the repository created by your instructor.
Add a new file to it,
 and modify an existing file (your instructor will tell you which one).
 When asked by your instructor,
 pull her changes from the repository to create a conflict,
 then resolve it.

2. What does Git do
 when there is a conflict in an image or some other non-textual file
 that is stored in version control?

3. You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a
 remote Git repository. During your work session, you take the following
 actions, but not in this order: 
 
 - *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file `numbers.txt`
 - *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
 - *Celebrate* your success with beer(s)
 - *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
 - *Stage changes* to be committed
 - *Commit changes* to the local repository

 In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances of
 conflicts? Put the commands above in order in the *action* column of the table
 below. When you have the order right, see if you can write the corresponding
 commands in the *command* column. A few steps are populated to get you
 started.

 |order|action . . . . . . . . . . |command . . . . . . . . . . |

 |2    |                           | `echo 100 >> numbers.txt`  |
 |3    |                           |                            |
